## Project Origin

The project began as a summer project aimed at developing a [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) core for learning purposes. Initially, a single-cycle version, named Pequeno Risco-5, was developed. The project quickly evolved into a multi-cycle version shortly after its inception.

This project was encouraged by Professor [Rodolfo Azevedo](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rodolfo/) from the [Institute of Computing](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/) at [UNICAMP](http://www.unicamp.br/), who suggested the construction of a single-cycle RISC-V processor and later a multi-cycle RISC-V. He also provided the first FPGAs used for testing and assisted with technical questions.

## Name

The name Risco-5 is a play on the name RISC-V, the architecture it implements, but it can also suggest something risky.
